# Short Assignment 2

## Summary

This flex program is designed to act like the `grep` tool. Given some search
word, it will parse some input file or `stdin`. If there is a match on the
word, it will print the line number and the text in the line where the
match occurred.

## Development

To create the program, run

```sh
make
```

You can clean up the build artifacts with

```sh
make clean
```
