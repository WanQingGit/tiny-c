# CS 57

## Summary

Work and solutions from my compilers class, COSC 57, at Dartmouth College,
taught by Vasantha Kommineni.

## Structure

There were three large assignments that we worked on in class. There are
folders that contain the solutions to each part that are in the folders
named: `project_{1, 2, 3}`.

Each folder has their own README and build files.
